Aim : To study and implement inheritance in Java
a) To calculate volume of sphere using multi level inheritance
Experiment 6 (b)  Write a program to calculate square ,square root and cube of a number ,illustrating the use of abstract  class and abstract method
6(c) Create a Java program to demonstrate the use of an interface for custom weather
information retrieval
 The WeatherService interface declares a method getWeatherInfo for retrieving
weather information.
 In the main method of the Main class, an anonymous class is created that
implements the WeatherService interface.
 Inside the anonymous class, the getWeatherInfo method implements the logic to
retrieve weather information. In this example, a mock response is returned
indicating sunny weather with a temperature of 25°C for the specified location.
 A sample location is provided.
 The getWeatherInfo method of the WeatherService interface is called to retrieve
weather information for the specified location.
 The retrieved weather information is printed to the console.

Aim: - To study and implement method overloading in Java
Problem Statement: - Write a program to find the Area of a Circle, a Rectangle, and a Triangle using
method overloading.

Exp 2
Aim: - To study and implement object, classes and methods in Java.
Problem Statement: -
a) Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named ‘Rectangle’ having
three methods. First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as
parameters, second method named as 'calculateArea' returns the area of the rectangle. Third
method named ‘calculatePerimeter’, returns the perimeter of the rectangle. ( Length and
breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard. area and perimeter values to be displayed
in main function use BufferedReader method).
b) Write a program to print Employee details by creating a class named ‘Employee’ having
methods as ‘getInfo’ which takes EmpId,EmpName and EmpSalary as parameters. Second
method as CalculateGrossSalary to calculate gross salary and third method to display employee
details (Gross Salary= Salary + DA +HRA ,where DA =10% of salary and HRA= 7% of salary, use
BufferedReader method).

Aim: - To study and implement basic programming constructs such as branching and looping in Java
a)Write a program to accept the three sides of triangle and display whether a valid triangle can be
formed or not ,if formed, whether it is an equilateral, isosceles or a scalene triangle and calculate its
area.
b) Write a program using for loop to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user (0 1 1 2 3
5 8 13 24 ....)
c) Write a program using while loop that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the
number with the digits reversed. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321
